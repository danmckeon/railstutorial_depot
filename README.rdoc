Entrepreneur and web developer finding innovative solutions to fight cancer. I'm passionate about scalable technologies that empower people to help themselves. For the last year, I've been building a website to help people who have cancer access clinical trials and recently attended Dev Bootcamp to take my web development skills to the next level. I love to work with others and bring strong organizational skills to a team. I've spent much of my career as a consultant to food companies helping achieve their sales and marketing goals. I'm a lifelong learner and am always eager to spend time building new skills. When I'm not building applications, you're likely to find me hiking, climbing, or backpacking in one of our National Forests or while traveling abroad.
